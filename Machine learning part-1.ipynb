What is a parameter?**\n","\n","A parameter is a configuration variable that is internal to the model and whose value can be estimated from the training data.\n","\n","**2. What is correlation?**\n","\n","Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.\n","\n","**3. What does negative correlation mean?**\n","\n","Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. The correlation coefficient lies between -1 and 0.\n","\n","**4. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?**\n","Machine Learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to allow computers to learn from data. Main components: data, model, algorithm, loss function, optimizer.\n","\n","**5. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?**\n","Loss measures how far the model's prediction is from the actual target. A smaller loss indicates a better model.\n","\n","**6. What are continuous and categorical variables?**\n","\n","Continuous variables take infinite values within a range (e.g., height, weight). Categorical variables have discrete categories (e.g., gender, color).\n","\n","**7. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?**\n","\n","Using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.\n","\n","**8. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?**\n","\n","Training data is used to fit the model; testing data is used to evaluate the model's performance.\n","\n","**9. What is sklearn.preprocessing?**\n","\n","A module in scikit-learn for preprocessing data, including scaling, encoding, and normalization.\n","\n","**10. What is a Test set?**\n","\n","A subset of the dataset used to test the model after training to evaluate its performance on unseen data.\n","\n","**11. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?**\n","Using `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n","\n","**12. How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?**\n","\n","Understand the problem, collect and clean data, perform EDA, preprocess, select and train model, evaluate, and tune.\n","\n","**13. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?**\n","\n","EDA helps understand the data, identify patterns, outliers, missing values, and determine appropriate preprocessing steps.\n","\n","**14. What is correlation?**\n","\n","(Repeated) It shows how strongly two variables are related.\n","\n","\n","**15. What does negative correlation mean?**\n","\n","(Repeated) One variable increases while the other decreases.\n","\n","**16. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?**\n","\n","Using `.corr()` method in pandas.\n","\n","**17. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.**\n","\n","Causation implies that one variable causes the change in another. Correlation only shows a relationship. E.g., Ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated but not causally linked.\n","\n","**18. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.**\n","\n","Optimizers adjust model parameters to minimize the loss. Types:\n","- Gradient Descent\n","- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n","- Adam\n","Example: `optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.01)`\n","\n","**19. What is sklearn.linear_model?**\n","\n","A module in scikit-learn with linear models like LinearRegression, LogisticRegression.\n","\n","**20. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?**\n","\n","Trains the model. Requires training data and target variable, e.g., `model.fit(X_train, y_train)`\n","\n","**21. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?**\n","\n","Predicts target values using the trained model. Requires input data, e.g., `model.predict(X_test)`\n","\n","**22. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?**\n","\n","Scaling transforms features to a similar range. It helps algorithms converge faster and perform better.\n","\n","**23. How do we perform scaling in Python?**\n","\n","Using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n","\n","**24. What is sklearn.preprocessing?**\n","\n","(Repeated) It's for scaling, normalization, and encoding of data.\n","\n","**25. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?**\n","\n","(Repeated) Use `train_test_split()` function from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n","\n","**26. Explain data encoding?**\n","\n","Transforming categorical data into numeric form so it can be used in models. Common methods: one-hot, label, and ordinal encoding.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"jLayeCBuUQrv"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"1AWgTGnlUIML"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}]}
